# credit-risk-classification

Overview of the analysis:

In this Challenge, I used various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. I used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

Results:

  Acuracy score:
    
    Accuracy is the percentage of correct predictions made by a model.
    
    For this model the balanced accuracy was calculated at 0.95 or 95%, meaning that 95 out of 100 predictions made were correct.
    
  Precision score:
    
    Precision, also known as a positive predictive value, measures how well a classifier predicts the positive class. 
    
    For this model the precision was higher for healthy loan prediction (0) than it was for high-risk loan prediction (1). The model showed a 1.0 precision score for the       healthy loans and 0.85 for high-risk loans. Overall I believe that this is still an acceptable model to use based on the precision scores acheived.
    
  Recall score:
    
    Recall, also known as sensitivity is a model's ability to detect positive values.
    
    For this model the recall values for healthy loans and high-risk loans respectively were 0.99 and 0.91. This model shows a high level of recall meaning that it is          correctly identifying those loans that are healthy or high-risk. 
    
  Summary:
  
  To summarize this model showed high accuracy, precision and recall for both healthy and high-risk loan analysis. I would recommend use of this prediction model for         your institution as I believe that it will generate accurate, reliable data regarding the risk of loans based on the historical data available for evaluation.
